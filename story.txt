Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Jojo,

I am writing to you from a big spaceship in a sweet galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a green rocket in January. There are 5 girls and boys of highschool here! In the
living room there is a pool full of coffee. I fall asleep each night on a Comfy bed of
Glass and dream of Watching movies adverb. It feels as though I have lived here for
9 min. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
working on a happy car!!

Best wishes,
jaemin
